This is a super basic app based on Twitter to illustrate Hotwire core concepts.
On one side, we have the list of Tweets, and on the other, a form to create a tweet. Upon creation, the list of tweets gets updated. Also, tweets can be edited in-place and removed.

# Usage
```
=> git clone https://github.com/bgvo/hotwire-demo.git
=> cd hotwire-demo
=> rails db:setup
=> foreman start -f Procfile.dev

# Go to localhost:3000
```
